# King County House Price Prediction (May 2014 - May 2015):

# Objective:
Developed a predictive model to estimate house prices in King County, Washington, leveraging a comprehensive dataset of housing attributes.

# Methodology:
Utilized diverse regression techniques, including linear regression, elastic net regression, random forest regression, support vector regression, and neural network regression.
Preprocessed data by handling missing values, addressing outliers, and transforming features to enhance model accuracy.
Evaluated model performance using key metrics such as R-squared, mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE).

# Data Visualization:
Employed scatterplots, histograms, and boxplots to gain insights into data patterns and relationships between variables.
Visualized the geographical distribution of property prices and their correlation with factors like waterfront location and square footage.

# Key Findings:
Identified significant correlations between house prices and attributes such as square footage, number of bedrooms, waterfront location, and view.
Observed seasonal trends in house prices, with variations across months and years.
Developed a robust predictive model capable of accurately estimating house prices based on relevant features.
This project demonstrates proficiency in data analysis, machine learning, and regression modeling techniques, as well as the ability to derive meaningful insights from complex datasets.
